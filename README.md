# Chilli Programming Language üå∂Ô∏è

Chilli is a dynamically-typed, interpreted, scripting programming language written in C++.

Still under developement but supports basic programming constructs such as:
1. function declartions and calls
2. variable declaration
3. if statements
4. while loops
5. for loops
6. lists

Run "run.bat" (if on windows) to compile the interpreter and to run the example file "main.chilli". Otherwise, compile the all .cpp files together as you would.

To run program (assuming you have compiled the interpreter and have name it "chilli"), do the following...

```
chilli <filename>
```

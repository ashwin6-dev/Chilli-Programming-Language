# Chilli Programming Language üå∂Ô∏è

Chilli is a dynamically-typed, interpreted, scripting programming language written in C++.

Still under developement but supports basic programming constructs such as:
1. function declartions and calls
2. variable declaration
3. if statements
4. while loops
5. for loops
6. lists

Run "run.bat" (if on windows) to compile the compiler and to run the example file "main.chilli".


To add...

1. Improve error handling (error messages are still too simple and not all errors are handled yet)
2. Extend syntax e.g add +=, -= etc
3. Create a documentation for the language
4. Add OOP
